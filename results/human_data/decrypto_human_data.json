Each keyword has a digit associated with it.\nFor example, if the keywords are {airplane, guitar, hat, plant}, the digits associated with them would be {1, 2, 3, 4}.\nThe keywords are fixed for the entire game, so the Encoder and Decoder must not reveal them.\n\nEach turn, the Encoder gets a secret code of 3 non-repeating digits between 1 and 4, e.g. 3-1-2.\nThey have to then provide 3 hints (one for each code digit) such that the Decoder can guess the code but the Interceptor cannot.\nThen, the Decoder and the Interceptor make their guesses and the code is revealed.\n\nThe Interceptor wins an Interception token if they successfully guess the code.\nThe Encoder and Decoder get a Miscommunication token if the Decoder fails to guess the code.\nThe Interceptor wins if it gets two Interception tokens, or if the Encoder and Decoder get two Miscommunication tokens.\nThe Encoder and Decoder team wins if it makes it through 8 rounds without triggering two Miscommunications or two Interceptions.\n\nThe hints must be one or two words, and make a reference to the meaning of the secret keyword of the corresponding digit.\nCodes are unique; the same code cannot occur twice in the same game.\n\nFor example, if the four secret keywords are\n{1: \"airplane\", 2: \"guitar\", 3: \"hat\", 4: \"plant\"}\nand the code for that turn is 3-1-2, which means that we need hints for {3: hat, 1: airplane, 2: guitar}, the Encoder could hint \n{3: gentleman, 1: wing, 2: music}.

Make sure that the ordering of the hints follows the order of the code.\nFor example:\n'''\nTo provide the hints, I need to think about the meaning of each keyword and come up with a one or two-word hint that makes a reference to it.\n\nFor the code 2-1-3, I need to give hints about the keywords associated with the digits 2, 1, and 3, which are \"hat\", \"fire\", and \"answer\" respectively.\n\nHere's my step-by-step thinking:\n\n- For the digit 2, the keyword is \"hat\". Since the previous hint for this keyword was \"top\", I want to give a hint that is different but still related to wearing a hat. One possible hint is \"cap\".\n\n- For the digit 1, the keyword is \"fire\". The previous hint for this keyword was \"heat\", so I want to give a hint that is related to fire but different from \"heat\". One possible hint is \"flame\".\n\n- For the digit 3, the keyword is \"answer\". A possible hint could be something related to giving an answer. One possible hint is \"solve\".\n\nSo, the final hints are:\n{\"hints\": [\"cap\", \"flame\", \"solve\"]}\n\nANSWER: {\"hints\": [\"cap\", \"flame\", \"solve\"]}'''\n\n ------ \n\nThis is the first turn.

Use the meaning of the keywords to come up with a one or two-word hint for each digit of the code.\nMake sure the order of the hints matches the order of the code.\nThen provide your three hints like \"ANSWER: {\"hints\": [\"hint_X\", \"hint_Y\", \"hint_Z\"]}\", where hint_X, hint_Y, hint_Z are your hints.\n"

However, considering the previous hint history (top, heat, lab), we can look for a connection between 'cap' and one of the keywords. The keyword 'hat' is associated with digit '2', and a hat is often worn on the head, which is covered by a cap. So, we can make a connection: {a: hat}.\n2. The hint for digit 'b' is 'flame', which is related to heat and fire. Since the keyword for digit '1' is 'fire', we can make a connection: {b: fire}.\n3. The hint for digit 'c' is 'solve', which is related to the keyword associated with digit '3', 'answer'. Since 'answer' is a solution to a problem, we can make a connection: {c: answer}.\n4. Now that we have the connections, we can determine the code by looking at the order of the hints: {a: hat, b: fire, c: answer}.

Make sure that the ordering of the hints follows the order of the code.\nFor example:\n'''\nTo provide the hints, I need to think about the meaning of each keyword and come up with a one or two-word hint that makes a reference to it.\n\nFor the code 2-1-3, I need to give hints about the keywords associated with the digits 2, 1, and 3, which are \"hat\", \"fire\", and \"answer\" respectively.\n\nHere's my step-by-step thinking:\n\n- For the digit 2, the keyword is \"hat\". Since the previous hint for this keyword was \"top\", I want to give a hint that is different but still related to wearing a hat. One possible hint is \"cap\".\n\n- For the digit 1, the keyword is \"fire\". The previous hint for this keyword was \"heat\", so I want to give a hint that is related to fire but different from \"heat\". One possible hint is \"flame\".\n\n- For the digit 3, the keyword is \"answer\". A possible hint could be something related to giving an answer. One possible hint is \"solve\".\n\nSo, the final hints are:\n{\"hints\": [\"cap\", \"flame\", \"solve\"]}\n\nANSWER: {\"hints\": [\"cap\", \"flame\", \"solve\"]}'''\n\n ------ \n\nThis is the first turn.

Use the meaning of the keywords to come up with a one or two-word hint for each digit of the code.\nMake sure the order of the hints matches the order of the code.\nThen provide your three hints like \"ANSWER: {\"hints\": [\"hint_X\", \"hint_Y\", \"hint_Z\"]}\", where hint_X, hint_Y, hint_Z are your hints.\n"

Make sure that the ordering of the guess follows the order of the hints.\nFor example:'''\n1. The hint for digit 'a' is 'cap', which doesn't seem to directly relate to any of the keywords. However, considering the previous hint history (top, heat, lab), we can look for a connection between 'cap' and one of the keywords. The keyword 'hat' is associated with digit '2', and a hat is often worn on the head, which is covered by a cap. So, we can make a connection: {a: hat}.\n2. The hint for digit 'b' is 'flame', which is related to heat and fire. Since the keyword for digit '1' is 'fire', we can make a connection: {b: fire}.\n3. The hint for digit 'c' is 'solve', which is related to the keyword associated with digit '3', 'answer'. Since 'answer' is a solution to a problem, we can make a connection: {c: answer}.\n4. Now that we have the connections, we can determine the code by looking at the order of the hints: {a: hat, b: fire, c: answer}. Therefore, the code is {2-1-3}.\n\nFinal answer:\nANSWER: {\"guess\": \"2-1-3\"}'''\n\n ------ \n\nThis is the first turn. There are no past hints or past codes.\n\nTurn 1: 0 Miscommunications, 0 Interceptions so far.\nYou are the decoder.\nThe four keywords are:\n    {1: honey,\n    2: population,\n    3: equipment,\n    4: loss}\n\nThe hints given by the Encoder for this turn are:\n    {a: virus,\n    b: suitcase,\n    c: ridge}\n\nFor example, you might think the following connections are true {a: X, b: Y, c: Z}, where X, Y, X are non-repeating digits from 1 to 4.\nYour guess should be in the order of the hints: {\"guess\": \"X-Y-Z\"}.\nWhat is your guess for the three-digit code? Apply concise, step-by-step thinking, double check the order, followed by your final answer as \"ANSWER: {\"guess\": \"X-Y-Z\"}\"."

The hint for digit 'c' is 'solve', which is related to the keyword associated with digit '3', 'answer'. Since 'answer' is a solution to a problem, we can make a connection: {c: answer}.\n4.

The hint for digit 'c' is 'solve', which is related to the keyword associated with digit '3', 'answer'. Since 'answer' is a solution to a problem, we can make a connection: {c: answer}.\n4.

The hint for digit 'b' is 'flame', which is related to heat and fire. Since the keyword for digit '1' is 'fire', we can make a connection: {b: fire}.\n3. The hint for digit 'c' is 'solve', which is related to the keyword associated with digit '3', 'answer'. Since 'answer' is a solution to a problem, we can make a connection: {c: answer}.\n4. Now that we have the connections, we can determine the code by looking at the order of the hints: {a: hat, b: fire, c: answer}.
